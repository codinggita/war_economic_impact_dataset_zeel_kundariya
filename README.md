## 📌 Project Overview

**War Economic Impact Analysis** is a comprehensive full-stack platform designed to analyze, visualize, and track the economic consequences of historical and ongoing conflicts. By processing a real-world dataset of **300,000+ conflict records**, the system provides deep insights into how wars affect global GDP, inflation, poverty, and unemployment rates.

The system is engineered to provide researchers, students, and policymakers with a structured, high-fidelity way to explore the economic devastation caused by warfare across different regions and time periods.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

-   **Scalable Architecture**: Build a robust RESTful API system using Node.js and Express.js.
-   **High-Performance Schema**: Design an optimized MongoDB schema capable of handling massive economic datasets.
-   **Advanced Discovery**: Implement multi-parameter filtering and complex regex-based search.
-   **Data-Driven Analytics**: Provide trending insights and peak impact data for conflicts.
-   **Security First**: Ensure secure user management and admin protection using JWT and Bcrypt.
-   **Clean Code Standards**: Strictly follow the MVC architecture and industry-standard best practices.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

Understanding the long-term economic damage of war is difficult due to:
-   ❌ **Scattered Data**: Economic statistics are often fragmented across multiple unorganized reports.
-   ❌ **Poor Visualization**: Hard to compare how different conflicts impact specific sectors (e.g., Agriculture vs. Energy).
-   ❌ **Lack of Searchability**: No centralized way to search for conflicts by specific inflation rates or reconstruction costs.
-   ❌ **No Predictive Context**: Difficult to identify "high-risk" zones or identifying recurring economic collapse trends.

---

## 💡 Solution

This project centralizes war-related economic data into a structured knowledge base where users can:
-   ✅ **Browse Conflicts**: Explore detailed records of World Wars, Civil Wars, and Interstate conflicts.
-   ✅ **Analyze Impact**: View detailed metrics on inflation, currency devaluation, and poverty spikes.
-   ✅ **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by region, country, status (Ongoing/Resolved), and specific economic thresholds.
-   ✅ **Analytics Dashboard**: Identify the highest war costs and reconstruction requirements globally.
-   ✅ **Proactive Security**: Protect sensitive administrative actions with robust JWT authentication.

## 🧠 Dataset Structure

The application processes a massive JSON dataset with records structured as follows:

```json
{
  "Conflict_Name": "Syrian Civil War",
  "Conflict_Type": "Civil War",
  "Region": "Middle East",
  "Start_Year": "2011",
  "End_Year": "2026",
  "Status": "Ongoing",
  "Primary_Country": "Syria",
  "GDP_Change_%": "-34.81",
  "Inflation_Rate_%": "55.45",
  "Cost_of_War_USD": "114215767997",
  "Estimated_Reconstruction_Cost_USD": "178638357922"
}
```

---

## 🗄️ Database Schema Design

The MongoDB schema is optimized for analytical queries and high-speed retrieval:

```javascript
{
  Conflict_Name: String,
  Conflict_Type: String,
  Region: String,
  Start_Year: String,
  End_Year: String,
  Status: String,
  Primary_Country: String,
  Economic_Metrics: {
    GDP_Change: Number,
    Inflation_Rate: Number,
    Currency_Devaluation: Number
  },
  Social_Impact: {
    Poverty_Rate: Number,
    Food_Insecurity: Number,
    Unemployment_Rate: Number
  },
  Financials: {
    Cost_of_War: Number,
    Reconstruction_Cost: Number
  }
}
```

### ✅ Key Design Decisions
-   **Hybrid Storage**: Core economic metrics are embedded within the conflict document for sub-second retrieval.
-   **Advanced Indexing**: Compound indexes on `Region`, `Status`, and `Conflict_Type`.
-   **Stateless Auth**: JWT implementation ensuring the backend is ready for horizontal scaling.
